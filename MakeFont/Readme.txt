MakeFont
========

A nice font texture page generator that uses your anti-aliased windows font-set. There are
two parameters to provide this program:

	Makefont.exe "Font name" c:/output_database.fdb

That simple!

The font database is read by my SDLApp framework and made ready for ease of use. This
should be provided in the zip along with this MakeFont utitlity.
